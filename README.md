# Blog Testing

To describe this project, it is a website, more precisely a Portfolio, where projects are automatically generated, to practice Gatsby.

## How I've made this website ?

It was mostly made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a static site generator based on [React](https://reactjs.org/), also with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), a query language to easily pull data from multiple sources using a single API call.

Additionally, the style was mainly done with `module.css`.

The live preview is available [here](https://snazzy-pie-9bd711.netlify.app/), have fun.
